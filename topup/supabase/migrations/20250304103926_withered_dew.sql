  # Fix RLS policies for resellers table

  1. Security Updates
    - Add public access policy for resellers table
    - Add public access policy for admin_settings table
    - Ensure proper permissions for authentication
  2. Notes
    - These policies allow public read/write access to the tables
    - In a production environment, you should restrict access more carefully
